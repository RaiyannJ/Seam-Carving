# Seam-Carving
In C, program that uses and abstract data type to resize images using the "Seam Carving" technique. Gradient energies of eahc pixel in an image is calcultaed. Implemented knowledge of data structures, lowest-cost algorithms and dynammic programming to remove seams from the image while maintaining key features and aspect ratio.
