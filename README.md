# Seam-Carving
In C, program that uses an abstract data type to resize images using the "Seam Carving" technique. Gradient energies of each pixel in an image is calculated. Implemented knowledge of data structures, lowest-cost algorithms and dynamic programming to remove seams from the image while maintaining key features and aspect ratio.
